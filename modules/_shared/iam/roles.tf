### Orchestrator Compartment-Level Policies
###
### These policies are created at the orchestrator compartment level and can be used by
### both tenant (tenancy-level) and compartment (compartment-level) deployments.
###
### NOTE: Tenancy-level policies are in modules/tenant/iam-roles.tf and
### modules/tenant/iam-roles-cloudscanner.tf because they require tenancy-level permissions.
