        # For work-in-progress PRs you can typically use draft pull requests
        # from Github. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have
        # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the
        # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the
        # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
        # Note that a second check will be reported if this is enabled.

        # to also validate the commit message for one commit PRs.
